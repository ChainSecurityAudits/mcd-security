# Program\_Summary

## Bug Bounty Program

The [Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/makerdao_bbp/hacktivity?order_direction=DESC&order_field=popular&filter=type%3Abounty-awarded) is a key component of our strategy to maximize security testing by approaching it from different angles and multiple layers to ensure the security of the MCD smart contracts.

### Timeline

* Initiated the Bug Bounty program privately for selected researchers \(Private testnet on June 3rd\).
* Launched our public bug bounty program on [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/makerdao_bbp) \(July 24th\).
* Bug Bounty Program to continue indefinitely.  

### Program Scope

The bug bounty program currently contains two separate scopes, which share the same rules with a few exceptions as noted below:

* Smart contracts for Multi-Collateral Dai.
* Infrastructure for select public facing domains \(please see the "Ineligible Bugs" section in the **Policy** section on HackerOne, especially regarding third party software, before submitting a report\).

**Note:** The program may be expanded in the future to include more asset types such as frontends and apps.

## Updates and Results

Since the launch of the program, we have discovered 3 "High" severity bugs and 1 "Critical" severity bug, totaling $90,000 in bug bounty payments. You can view all the disclosed reports [here](https://hackerone.com/makerdao_bbp/hacktivity?order_direction=DESC&order_field=popular&filter=type%3Abounty-awarded). Given that the initial goal for the bug bounty program was to open up the audit efforts to the community, we are pleased to see that the findings show that the program is working successfully. The bug bounty program will be continued indefinitely.
